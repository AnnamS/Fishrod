Hello Gavin,

I tried very hard to get the hang of Symfony 2 but unfortunately I didn't have enough time to grasp it properly.
However, I have managed to successfully install Symfony 2 on my MacBook, but this took a majority of my time,
as I had to go through an array of procedures and installations to actually get up and running.

I have also managed to create a new project called weddingplan. Included in this repository is the configurations, 
parameters, bundle and controllers. I managed to briefly understand how the MVC structure works and found out 
information about it such as how Models aren't always required. However, I didn't manage to implement it.

On my localhost, I set up the database using the ORM. There is a simple login page in the repository that is meant to
validate the admin credentials. However, this too gave me problems as it wasn't using MVC and couldn't connect to the
database.

Thank you for your time and allowing me to have this opportunity to apply for your company. It has been a great learning
experience as I got to know about Symfony 2, which is completely new to me. I will take this on and continue to learn
exactly how this framework should be used.

I apologise for not being able to fully complete the task I was given.

Regards,

Annam Siddique
